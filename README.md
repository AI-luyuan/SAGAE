# SAGAE

SAGAE is a graph autoencoder model based on self-attention feature fusion, designed for predicting the association between drugs and diseases. What sets SAGAE apart is its use of self-attention mechanisms, which enhance the mutual understanding between candidate drugs and disease features. This addresses a limitation in current graph neural network methods, which primarily focus on node information interactions within the graph, often neglecting the need for personalized and context-aware learning for candidate drugs and diseases.

## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested under Python 3.8.10. The required packages are:
- numpy == 1.21.1
- pandas == 1.4.3
- scipy == 1.10.1
- pytorch == 2.0.1
- pytorch-lightning==1.9.0
- scikit-learn == 0.23.2

We will actively maintain the code on Github. People with implementation problems can open an issue via Github online. 

## Example to Run the Code

```python demo.py```
